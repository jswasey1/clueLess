I've compiled a list of existing bugs from my testing. They have a categorization next to them of the severity/type of bug


Navigation
-----------
1. Fix bug with the move options. When selecting, it only highlights the text of the room selection. - COSMETIC
2. Fix Move options. This is currently a one-shot deal. If you select a room. it Goes to said room. Maybe add a button
   to ask if the player is sure. - MINOR NON_FUNCTIONAL
3. Potential issue (untested): The room coordinates MAY need to change. - MAJOR FUNCTIONAL ISSUE
4. If a Movement fails (this has only occured in testing), the whole game freezes up. It does not allow new players to connect
   nor does it allow the user to do anything. The app.js has to be restarted. - MAJOR FUNCTIONAL ISSUE

Players
----------
1. Spawning players is an issue. They All automatically spawn to the x and y coordinates in the app.js Player.self declaration 
   - MAJOR FUNCTIONAL
2. Players NOT appearing is an issue. They show up on some views, but not all - MAJOR FUNCTIONAL
3. Players disappearing behind board after moving - MINOR FUNCTIONAL
4. If players are located in the same room, they just stack ontop of one another. Difficult to display. - COSMETIC
